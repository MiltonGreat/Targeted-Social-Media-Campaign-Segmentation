## Project Overview

In this project, we perform user segmentation based on their engagement data from social media ads. Using clustering algorithms like KMeans, we identify groups of users with similar engagement patterns, which can help optimize marketing strategies by focusing on key audience segments.

## Dataset

The dataset is a comprehensive collection of data related to various social media advertising campaigns. It includes engagement metrics like impressions, clicks, spend, and conversion rates, across multiple platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and Twitter.

### Features:

- **Campaign_ID**: Unique ID of each campaign.
- **Target_Audience**: Demographic information about the target audience.
- **Campaign_Goal**: The objective of the campaign (e.g., Product Launch, Increase Sales).
- **Conversion_Rate**: The rate at which users convert after viewing the ad.
- **Acquisition_Cost**: The cost of acquiring a customer.
- **Clicks**: Number of clicks the ad received.
- **Impressions**: Number of times the ad was shown.
- **Engagement_Score**: A custom metric indicating user engagement with the ad.
- **ROAS**: Return on Advertising Spend.
- **CTR**: Click-through Rate.
- **CLTV**: Customer Lifetime Value (proxy).

## Objective

The primary goal of the project is to group users based on their engagement with ads using clustering algorithms, enabling better understanding of customer segments. This can help businesses target specific groups more effectively and optimize their ad spend.

## Features

We use key engagement metrics to perform clustering:

- **CTR**: Click-through Rate.
- **Engagement Rate**: Engagement score divided by impressions.
- **ROAS**: Return on Advertising Spend.
- **CLTV**: Customer Lifetime Value (proxy).
- **Total Spend**: The total cost spent on a campaign.

## Project Workflow

### Data Preprocessing

1. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Missing values were filled with the median or mode, depending on the feature type.
   - Outliers in numeric columns such as `Acquisition_Cost`, `Clicks`, `Impressions`, and `Engagement_Score` were detected and handled using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
   
2. **Feature Scaling**: 
   - We applied **MinMaxScaler** to normalize numerical features such as `Acquisition_Cost`, `CTR`, `ROAS`, and `CLTV` for better clustering performance.

3. **One-Hot Encoding**: 
   - Categorical features such as `Target_Audience`, `Campaign_Goal`, and `Channel_Used` were encoded using one-hot encoding to convert them into numerical format.

### Feature Engineering

- **Cost per Acquisition (CPA)**: Derived as `Acquisition_Cost / (Conversion_Rate * Clicks)`.
- **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**: Calculated as `Clicks / Impressions`.
- **Engagement Rate**: Computed as `Engagement_Score / Impressions`.
- **ROAS**: Return on Advertising Spend, calculated as `(Clicks * Conversion_Rate * CPA) / Total_Spend`.
- **CLTV**: Proxy for Customer Lifetime Value, derived as `Conversion_Rate * Total_Spend * Engagement_Rate`.

### Clustering

1. **KMeans Clustering**: 
   - We used the **KMeans** algorithm to group users into clusters based on engagement data. The optimal number of clusters was determined using the **Elbow Method**, which involves plotting the sum of squared errors (SSE) against the number of clusters.
   
2. **Dimensionality Reduction**: 
   - **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** was used to reduce the feature dimensions to two components for better visualization of the clusters.

### Cluster Evaluation

- **Silhouette Score**: We computed the silhouette score to evaluate how well each point fits within its cluster. A higher silhouette score indicates better-defined clusters.

### Cluster Profiling

- **Cluster Analysis**: We performed cluster profiling by aggregating the numerical features (such as CTR, Engagement Rate, and ROAS) to understand the key characteristics of each cluster. This helps in identifying which segments perform better in terms of ad engagement and spend efficiency.

## Key Insights

1. **Optimal Number of Clusters**: 
   - Based on the Elbow Method and silhouette score, the optimal number of clusters was found to be 3, each representing distinct engagement patterns.
   
2. **Cluster Profiles**:
   - **Cluster 0**: High-engagement users with a relatively high **CLTV**, high **CTR**, and moderate **Total Spend**. These users are prime candidates for focused marketing efforts.
   - **Cluster 1**: Users with moderate engagement but high ad spend. Targeting these users with more personalized campaigns could improve ROI.
   - **Cluster 2**: Low-engagement users with low CLTV and ROI. These users may need less ad spend or more targeted efforts to increase engagement.

3. **Visualization**:
   - **PCA Visualization**: The reduced dimensions using PCA showed distinct clusters of users, allowing easy interpretation of the different segments.

### Code Explanation and Insights

#### Code Overview:

The code is designed to segment users based on their engagement data from social media ads. Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - The dataset is loaded, and missing values are handled by filling numerical columns with the median value and categorical columns with the mode.
   - Outliers are removed using the IQR method, ensuring clean data for clustering.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Key engagement-related features are derived:
     - **CTR** (Click-through Rate)
     - **ROAS** (Return on Ad Spend)
     - **CLTV** (Customer Lifetime Value proxy)
   - These derived metrics help create meaningful clusters based on user behavior.

3. **Clustering**:
   - **KMeans Clustering** is applied to segment users into clusters based on their engagement data.
   - The **Elbow Method** is used to determine the optimal number of clusters by plotting SSE (sum of squared errors) for different numbers of clusters.
   - The best cluster count is found to be 3, based on the Elbow Method and silhouette score.

4. **Cluster Profiling**:
   - Cluster 0: Users with high **CTR**, **CLTV**, and high engagement rates.
   - Cluster 1: Moderate engagement users with high ad spend and **ROI**.
   - Cluster 2: Low-engagement users with low **ROI** and **CLTV**.

5. **PCA Visualization**:
   - The clusters are visualized using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce the dimensionality to 2 components. This helps in understanding the spread and separability of the clusters.

#### Key Insights from the Output:

1. **Cluster Segmentation**:
   - The users were grouped into three distinct clusters based on engagement metrics like CTR, CLTV, and Total Spend.
   - The clusters provide valuable insights into user behavior, allowing targeted advertising for each group.

2. **Silhouette Score**:
   - The silhouette score is 0.57, which indicates fairly good clustering performance. A score closer to 1 would mean well-separated clusters.

3. **Cluster Profiling**:
   - **Cluster 0**: High-engagement, high-value users, ideal for ad spend maximization.
   - **Cluster 1**: Moderate engagement, high spend usersâ€”opportunity to improve efficiency.
   - **Cluster 2**: Low-engagement users, possible candidates for reduced ad targeting.

By leveraging these insights, marketers can adjust their strategies to focus on high-value users while potentially reducing ad spend on low-engagement segments.
